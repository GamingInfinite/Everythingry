# Everythingry
Wiki anything and everything.

## The Goal
I'm designing this site with a singular goal in mind.  To cover a wide range of topics while being both detailed and easy to read.  The biggest motivator here for me is that I love playing large scale rpgs and games that have so much content that you need to make multiple runthroughs to even experience every fascet of the games engine and gameplay customizability.  Or even just sandbox games like Minecraft or Terraria where there are obscure or niche tricks that add to your quality of life as a player of the game, but aren't really discussed even on their own dedicated wiki.

Basically I'm gonna take everything that I've ever ended up looking up for anything, from general to obscure to spoilery, for video games, movies, school, cooking, you name it.  If I had to look it up and it feels worth adding, it's going in here.

For more information on my personal examples, please proceed to the section labeled Examples.

## Submissions & Requests
If you want to add a new page for a game you love playing, or really feel like sharing a cooking recipe that you tried and really enjoyed, this section is for you.

There are 2 ways to go about this:

### Method 1:
Make a GitHub issue.  Since I'll be adding to this repository with my own information documented from different wikis I'm using for games I'm playing and different concepts I'm learning about, I'll probably see it.  Just make sure to include all relevant information, and format it like you would want to see it on the page.  If it's unclear to me, but does seem like an interesting read, I'll polish it a bit by researching it myself and adding details that I found, or rewording parts of it to be a bit clearer.

### Method 2:
Make the page yourself, and make a pull request using GitHub.  I'll still review the actual content of the page as stated in Method 1, but It'll save me a lot of headache for trying to set the page up on my end, I just review and release.

## Examples
My personal example (and reason why I'm even creating this site) is how many different websites I ended up looking up for Persona 5 Royal.  The Shin Megami Tensei Franchise has it's own wiki including all of the Persona games, but looking up confidants, different enemies, when specific things can occur, all were found on their own sites either in Guides created by Polygon or IGN, or on seperate sites that just covered very specific topics, where I then had to look something else up just to find something else.

This is where the idea stemmed from, and it's similar to a website I remember seeing a while back (when I find it I will post link here) where it was bassically documentation for code packages for a variety of different coding languages that either did not have their own documentation or were very poorly documented, and other developers that ended up using it posted their findings and how to do different things with it.

While this wiki *probably* won't have nearly as comprehensive lore things about Persona or SMT like their main wiki does, my plan is to take any information that I end up looking up, being as general as P5R confidant abilities to as specific or spoilery as what confidants do I need to unlock 3rd semester or why the hell specific confidants won't hang out on certain dates.
