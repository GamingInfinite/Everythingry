    Welcome to the page for Dungeons & Dragons. Here I will (at least begin) to
    <!-- svelte-ignore a11y-missing-attribute -->
    catalog every class and race for Dungeons and Dragons.
    <a class="text-red-600"
      >Doing this is going to take a while. I'm mainly going to keep this
      catalog up to date as I add content to my Dungeons and Dragons tool,
      VoidMaster, which is also linked below. Bear in mind, it's NOT a complete
      tooling, and if something is missing from this page that is not already in
      VoidMaster, you'll just have to wait some more.</a
    >
    In the mean time, you can use the rest of the wiki, and start writing up your
    own materials to be added to it.
    <br />
    It should also be noted that while this is labeled as Dungeons and Dragons, I'm
    aware of the current situation, and how the community at large is at odds with
    WOTC. I would like the record to reflect that I do NOT support WOTC's handling
    of community created content and third party published content like Critical
    Role's Exandria books. There have been rumors that Critical Role has been working
    on their own TTRPG, and should that be true they will have their own page. That
    does NOT mean that I will remove this one. Any and all D&D content on this wiki
    will remain for as long as WOTC is still producing Dungeons and Dragons, and
    even after so that people may see the rules and stil play.
    <br />
    That being said, VoidMaster 5e upon the discovery of a new TTRPG that supplants
    D&D, like the rumored one from Critical Role, so long as they have an open standard
    for community content and aren't as restricitve as WOTC is being, will be removed
    from this page and put on the page of the new TTRPG, and will cease support for
    Dungeons and Dragons as a whole.
