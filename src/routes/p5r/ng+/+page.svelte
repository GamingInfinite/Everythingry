    This is mostly just a forum for me to shit on the different confidants and
    as I'm typing this I'm losing steam so come on.

    Aight so to start with we've got the first 2 confidants you unlock, Morgana
    and Ryuji. Morgana straight up unlocks as you play the game, so you don't
    even have to worry. Ryuji on the other hand, his gift only unlocks Stealth
    Dash and Harisen Recovery by default, so you probably want to go ahead and
    rank him up for instant kill

  <div class="flex flex-row flex-wrap justify-center m-3 mx-8 gap-5">
    Ann much like Ryuji only has like 2 of her less useful abilities unlocked,
    so if you want her evolved persona or something else like the endure ability
    on her you're gonna need to work her confidant again.

    Mishima is the next forced confidant pickup, but literally he's a fire and
    forget. All his abilities are autounlocked upon getting his confidant with
    his NG+ item. If you rank 10 him your first run, your set for the rest of
    your playtime for NG+
  </div>
  <div class="flex flex-row flex-wrap justify-center m-3 mx-8 gap-5">
    The rest of this will be in order of usefulness

    Get Kawakami and Futaba's NG+ confidant items as soon as possible. Kawakami
    allows you to user her Rank 10 skill of letting you use your time slot for
    evening even after doing Mementos or Palace stuff, giving you MUCH more time
    to do other things like train or do things with Iwai or something. Futaba's
    is just useful for Mementos grinding as it auto unlocks her floor scan
    ability.
