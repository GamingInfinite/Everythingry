        Some Notes On Interacting With Caroline and Justine:
      </div>
      In order to rank them up you MUST go to the Velvet room and speak to them after
      fusing/summoning the Persona they request with the correct ability on it.<br

      Outings with Caroline and Justine do NOT contribute to Confidant Rank with
